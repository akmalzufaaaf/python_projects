# It's handman project

The Hangman game is a word guessing game in which one player thinks of a word, and the other player attempts to guess it by suggesting letters or the whole word, within a limited number of incorrect guesses.

Here's how it works:

1) The word to be guessed is represented by a series of underscores, with each underscore representing a letter in the word.
2) The player guessing the word proposes letters one at a time.
3) If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the appropriate positions.
4) If the guessed letter is incorrect, the number of incorrect guesses increases.
5) The game ends when either:
- The player guesses the word correctly, or
- The player reaches the maximum allowed number of incorrect guesses (usually depicted by a drawing of
  a hangman figure).

Feature added by myself:
* It will limit user to only enter the same number of letter that the word have, so user can use the entire letter to win the game.
* Also, it will be case insensitive.

Want to add:
* More vocabulary.
