# Rock, Paper, Scissor Game

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game played between two players. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: rock, paper, or scissors. The outcome is determined by the following rules:

* Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins).
* Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins).
* Paper covers Rock (Paper wins).

If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie.

# Added feature:
* Point system
The Feature Point System adds a competitive element to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, allowing players to accumulate points based on their performance. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1) Each win earns the player 1 point.
2) Each loss results in a 0 point.
3) A tie results in no points awarded.

The player's total points are displayed after each round, giving them a sense of progress throughout the game. The point system can be used to track performance over multiple rounds, helping players monitor their success rate and aim for higher scores.

This feature enhances the game's replay value, allowing players to challenge themselves or compete with others for the highest score.
